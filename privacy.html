      <div class="col-12">
        <p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Sobriety Soft’s website and our apps for
          iPhone and any other devices and platforms.</p>
      </div>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>New Big Book App accounts are created anonymously, without email addresses or passwords.</p>

    <p>You will be required to use an email address to create an account. Email addresses are only used for logging in,
      password resets, responding to emails that you initiate, and sending notifications that you request. We don’t send
      promotional emails.</p>

    <p>We may store information about your podcasts, episodes, and listening progress to sync this information between
      the website and your devices. We also collect anonymous statistics about which podcasts are most popular to help
      inform our recommendation engine.</p>

    <h2>Technical basics</h2>
    <p>If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them.</p>

    <p>Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or
      logs.</p>

    <h2>Amazon</h2>
    <p>Big Book App stores some of your data in Amazon's cloud service, such as posts and login credentials, to provide
      the best possible service.</p>

    <h2>Ads and analytics</h2>
    <p>The Big Book App collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular
      features, to improve the app.</p>

    <h2>Information usage</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.</p>

    <p>We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Sobriety
      Soft's functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people
      listen to a particular podcast inside the Big Book App.</p>

    <p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise
      our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
      activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.</p>

    <p>In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user
      information may be among the transferred assets.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication
      with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. Passwords are hashed, not stored, using
      industry-standard methods and are inaccessable to anybody at Sobriety Soft.</p>

    <h2>Accessing, changing, or deleting information</h2>
    <p>You may access or change your information from the Big Book App.</p>

    <p>To delete your account contact us at privacy@sobrietysoft.org</p>

    <p>Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are encrypted and are only accessed if
      needed for disaster recovery.</p>

    <p>Sobriety Soft may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal
      concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.</p>

    <h2>Third-party links and content</h2>
    <p>The Big Book App displays links and content from third-party podcast feeds and sites, and downloads podcast files
      directly from each podcast’s third-party servers. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have
      no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.</p>

    <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>
    <p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal
      information to outside parties without your consent.</p>

    <h2>Information for European Union Customers</h2>
    <p>By using the Big Book App and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your
      information outside of the European Union.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers of Information</h2>
    <p>Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws
      vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed,
      stored, or used.</p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>Contacting Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email privacy@sobrietysoft.org. Please note that
      account deletion should be done within the Overcast app, not via email requests, for security reasons.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Summary of changes so far:
